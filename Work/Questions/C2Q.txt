2.24 (Largest and Smallest Integers) Write an application that reads five integers and determines
and prints the largest and smallest integers in the group. Use only the programming techniques you
learned in this chapter.

2.25 (Odd or Even) Write an application that reads an integer and determines and prints wheth-
er it’s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of 2. Any mul-
tiple of 2 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.]

2.26 (Multiples) Write an application that reads two integers, determines whether the first is a
multiple of the second and prints the result. [Hint: Use the remainder operator.]
